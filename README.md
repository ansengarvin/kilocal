# Kilocal Nutrition Tracker

A lightweight, cloud-based nutrition dashboard designed to make calorie counting and macronutrient tracking as simple and easy as possible.

## The Motivation

I built this project for a few reasons:

1. I was unsatisfied with other nutrition trackers that I had tried in the past, which were either excessively paywalled or overly complicated with unneeded features.
2. I wanted to deepen my understanding of cloud-native technologies and cloud hosting by deploying to a real cloud platform
3. I wanted hands-on experience implementing CI/CD pipeline
